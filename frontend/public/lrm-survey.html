<h1>LRM search experience survey</h1>

<p>We kindly invite you to participate in a task-based survey with the purpose of exploring various
aspects of bibliographic data. We do not expect any particular knowledge in advance. In the survey you will be asked
to perform specific tasks and judgements related to specific queries.</p>

<h2>The survey system</h2>
<p>The survey system mimics a library search system where each entry in the search result represents a grouping based on
the content of publications. For each task, you will get a predefined query and result listing (using a predefined link). Each entry can be expanded to
what items are available for this content using the "Available as: " option. On the top of the page is a button that can be used to
hide and show all available items.</p>
<p>To the left of the display, under the icons indicating content type, there are two circular buttons with arrows that can be used to
indicate how you assess items according to the task given. The up arrow is used to give positive feedback on an item, the down arrow to give negative feedback.
Relevant items are marked with green for positive and red for negative. Your feedback can be reset by clicking on the cancel button. </p>
<p>When you have completed the task, click on the "Submit" button to send your feedback. This will show a dialog where you have to rate your own expertise.</p>
